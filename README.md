# Reinforcement Learning & Self-Organizing Maps

1. **SOM for COVID-19 Data Visualization on the World Map**
    - Description: This project applies Self Organizing Maps (SOM) on the attached Covid19 dataset that
gives country-wise data of COVID19 confirmed, recovered and expired cases by Jan 2021. SOM clusters the data so that each country will belong to a cluster. 
    - Files:
        - `SOM.ipynb`: Python notebook script for implementing SOM for COVID-19 data visualization.
        - `Q1_countrydata.csv`: csv file with data.

2. **Reinforcement Learning using Value Iteration on Basic Grid World**
    - Description: This project implements Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the value iteration algorithm on a basic grid world environment i.e. Frozen Lake environment available in openAI gym. It serves as a simple demonstration of RL concepts applied to a discrete grid-based environment.
    - Files:
        - `ValueIteration_GridWorld.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the grid world environment and value iteration algorithm
